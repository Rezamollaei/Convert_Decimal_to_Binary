This code converts a positive decimal number into its binary representation:

Purpose:

Converts a user-provided decimal number into binary using an iterative method.
How It Works:

The user is prompted to input a positive integer.
The binary function calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the number.
It iteratively checks each power of 2, starting from the largest, printing 1 if it fits into the number and subtracting it, or 0 otherwise.
The binary representation is printed in a single line.
